          <h3 className="">This beautiful resort – at the lovely shore, just a few miles north of Lahaina - offers beauty, comfort, and a tropical retreat for all who visit the enchanting island of Maui. Relax and let go of all worries at this balmy home away from home. Take a dip in the free-form swimming pool and enjoy the peaceful sound of the waterfalls surrounding you.</h3>
          <h3 className="">Warm up in the sandy-bottomed whirlpool after a great workout in the fitness center. Our onsite island activities desk will help you see the best of Maui, but don’t miss out on our beach; only steps away from the resort.</h3>
